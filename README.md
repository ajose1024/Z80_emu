---- 

This the ADM (Assembler / Disassembler / Monitor) for the Z80 microprocessor, implmeneted in JAVA

This suit has the code for the following ADM modules:

  * Assembler
  * Disassembler
  * Monitor

The Assembler will receive a Z80 assembly code and will assemble it producing Z80 code that can be 
executed on the Z80 monitor.

The Disassembler will receive Z80 machine code and will disasseble it onto Z80 assembly code.

The Monitor will allow to execute Z80 machine code, either in free-run or step-by-step mode, view
and modificatio of the Z80 registers, Z80 memory and Z80 I/O address space
